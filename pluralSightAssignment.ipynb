    "Chat GPT is a powerful tool that can be used for many instances in broad contexts. In this example we used it to expedite idea generation and begin more user focused research by generating ideas that could be used for marketing a beverage. Although users should be cautioned before implementing it as a customer support chat bot or for legal documents. Remember, that this AI simply mimics human speech like a parrot and does not understand the meanings behind its words. It simply puts words together based on probability and context to make the most coherent sentence it can."
